#Goal: Demonstrate the features of display-Block


  1. Display-Block comes by default on Li's because the browser determines it that way.
  2. The Display-Block Allows us to define a height and width for the elements. 
  3. However, the Display-Block occupies the entire length of the line, it is not recommended to include elements on the same line.
  4. When height and width are not defined, the display-block will occupy the entire length of the line.
